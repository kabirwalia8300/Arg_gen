       "'the mandate falls under taxation and general welfare powers  an insurance mandate would be enforced through income tax laws  so even if a simple mandate were not a valid  regulation   it still could fall easily within congress s plenary power to tax income  for instance  anyone purchasing insurance could be given an income tax credit  and those not purchasing could be assessed an income tax penalty   the only possible constitutional restriction is an archaic provision saying that if congress imposes anything that amounts to a  head tax  or  poll tax   that is  taxing people simply as people rather than taxing their income   then it must do so uniformly  that is  the same amount per person   this technical restriction is easily avoided by using income tax laws   purists complain that taxes should be proportional to actual income and should not be used mainly to regulate economic behaviour  but our tax code  for better or worse  is riddled with such regulatory provisions and so they are clearly constitutional       in many ways  the  mandate  could be considered a tax  but a tax which people would not have to pay if they purchased health insurance  the house bill imposes a tax of      on adjusted gross income if a taxpayer is not part of a qualified health insurance program  the senate bill imposes what is called an  excise tax   a tax on transactions or events  or a  penalty tax   a tax for failing to do something  e g   filing your tax return promptly   the tax is levied for each month that an individual fails to pay premiums into a qualified health plan  taxing uninsured people helps to pay for the costs of the new regulations  the tax gives uninsured people a choice  if they stay out of the risk pool  they effectively raise other people s insurance costs  and congress taxes them to recoup some of the costs  if they join the risk pool  they do not have to pay the tax  a good analogy would be a tax on polluters who fail to install pollution control equipment  they can pay the tax or install the equipment       health insurance mandates incentivize behaviour like many other laws  at one time  the supreme court restricted the ability of congress to use its taxing power to regulate people s activities  in the early part of the   th century  the court drew a distinction between taxes designed to raise revenue  which were permissible  and taxes designed to regulate behaviour  which might not be permissible  however  this distinction was jettisoned by       and the taxing power is now recognized as a broad congressional power      moreover  congress has the power to make laws which promote the general welfare  as democratic house majority leader steny hoyer argued in november of        well  in promoting the general welfare the constitution obviously gives broad authority to congress to effect that end  the end that we re trying to effect is to make health care affordable  so i think clearly this is within our constitutional responsibility   the words  general welfare  show up in the first line of article i  section   of the us constitution   the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes  duties  imposts and excises  to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states        the power to promote the general welfare becomes crucial when it is considered that it is impossible to create a national health insurance system and help the current    million uninsured is to mandate everyone to buy health insurance  you cannot have universal health insurance without a mandate  every country in the world that has a universal health insurance system either requires its citizens to buy health insurance  or includes its citizens in a default insurance programme automatically and taxes them for it  which is effectively the same thing   the reasons for this are simple  and have been covered hundreds of times since the current debate over universal health insurance began during the democratic presidential primaries in late       if citizens within a state are not obliged to participate in a healthcare scheme  whether privately of publicly organised   then many young and healthy people will bet on not needing insurance  and will decline to buy it  such behaviour will alter the composition of the risk pool  such that it is made up of older  sicker people with higher medical costs  and thus premiums will rise  that in turn will cause more healthy people to leave the system  this is the phenomenon of  adverse selection   ultimately you re left only with rich old sick people  and nobody else can afford insurance  this is known  somewhat histrionically  as an  insurance death spiral    states that wish to pursue the goal of creating an affordable  universally available system of healthcare  must ensure that the majority of their citizens buy into such a scheme      because there is a compelling benefit to the  general welfare  in instituting a national welfare program  the federal government may rely on constitutional authority to impose a health insurance mandate  if the states were left to do this  with some instituting a mandate and some not  many would be left uninsured and the risk pool would not be adequately spread  the difference in benefits to the country clearly justifies federal action to create this individual mandate under the constitution  '"
